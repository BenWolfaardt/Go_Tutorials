# Go Tutorials

This repository contains various tutorials that I have worked through in order to increase my skills in `Go` such as to improve my knowledge for my current job, be able to apply these newly learnt skills to other projects, as well as to learn how to create the backend for my personal website: [benwolfaardt.com](benwolfaardt.com) (comming soon!)

> As not to ocupy too many repositories with "tutorials" I've decided to group them into a single repository by making use of the `git`'s `orphan` command - allowing you to have independent branches with their own independant `git` history. Further details can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/BenWolfaardt/50905fa3e10d73b3622a3148afffed09).

### Naming convention of branches:
> Before the `-` is the tutorial's website name;
